## Introduction

This section covers the basics of operating systems, including the types of systems, OS services, and system calls. You'll learn about layered and virtual machines and the structure of various operating systems.

## Processes, Threads, and Scheduling

- **Processes**: Definition, lifecycle, state transitions, and control blocks.
- **Threads**: Fundamentals, benefits, and concept of multithreading.
- **Scheduling**: Different types of schedulers and scheduling criteria, including FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and more.

## Inter-Process Communication

Explore various IPC mechanisms such as critical sections, semaphores, and message passing. Classical problems like the Reader & Writer Problem and Dinning Philosophers Problem are included.

## Deadlocks

Learn about the conditions that lead to deadlocks, prevention techniques, and recovery methods, including Banker's algorithm.

## Memory Management

- **Basics**: Concept, logical and physical address mapping, and memory allocation techniques.
- **Paging**: Principles of paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.
- **Replacement Algorithms**: FIFO, LRU, and optimal page replacement strategies.

## I/O Systems and File Management

Understand the hardware/software interface, file concepts, and disk scheduling algorithms. Topics include FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and disk reliability.
